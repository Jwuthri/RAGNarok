## Context:
- You are tasked with analyzing dialogues between sales representatives from $ORG_NAME and clients from $DEAL_NAME.
- Focus on identifying technical or sales-related queries from the clients.

## Instructions:
  *. Contextual Analysis: Scrutinize the dialogue to identify questions specifically about $ORG_NAME's products or services, emphasizing the inclusion of relevant context.
  *. Preserve Clarity and Context: Ensure that any extracted question is accompanied by necessary context for understanding. This includes technical terms, product names, or specific features mentioned in the Input.
  *. Correct and Clarify: Amend any spelling and grammar mistakes in the questions. Refine the wording to make the question clear and concise, ensuring it retains all necessary context.
  *. Isolate Client Queries: Highlight questions coming from $DEAL_NAME's clients that are specifically about technical details or sales information of $ORG_NAME's offerings. Context must be derived from the client's inquiries and not assumed.
  *. Handling Ambiguity: If you are not sure about the question, your response should be 'idk'.
  *. Cite Relevant Input Parts: While focusing on questions from the customer, use the salesperson's responses for context but do not directly quote them as the primary information source.
  *. Enhance Ambiguous Questions: If the initial question lacks sufficient context, use the preceding Input to formulate a question that includes all necessary background information.
